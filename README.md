# Introduction
The Employee Database Management System (EDMS) is a web-based solution designed to streamline the management of employee records within an organization. It provides two main interfaces: a client panel for employees to view and manage their personal data, and an admin panel for HR or management to handle operations like attendance, payroll, and performance tracking. This system enhances accuracy, improves efficiency, and ensures secure, centralized data handling.

# Key Features of the Employee Database Management System
Employee Information Management: Centralized storage of personal details, contact info, job roles, and documents for easy access and updates.

Attendance and Leave Tracking: Automated tracking of daily attendance and leave requests with real-time status updates and approvals.

Payroll Management: Calculation and management of employee salaries, deductions, and payslip generation.

Performance Evaluation: Tools for tracking employee performance, setting goals, and generating appraisal reports.

Secure Admin and Client Panels: Role-based access with separate dashboards for employees and administrators, ensuring data privacy and security.
